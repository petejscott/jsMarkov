You can put the cat
in the cardboard box
or in the bellfry or in the attic.

The dog can be put in the yard, where he can play in the sandbox. 

In the basement is the mouse. You can put the mouse in the basement in the cardboard box, too! But you shouldn't if the cat is in there, or the cat will eat the mouse.
